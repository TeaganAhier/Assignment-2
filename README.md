# Snack Man – JavaScript Maze Game

This project is my Assignment 2 submission for Web Development, where I created a Pac-Man style maze game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of the assignment was to design and build an interactive browser-based game that demonstrated key concepts such as DOM manipulation, game logic, collision detection, event handling and dynamic rendering.

Snack Man begins with a menu where the player can choose either one-player or two-player mode before the game starts. Once the game loads, the player navigates through a maze, collecting points while avoiding moving enemies. When all points are collected, the game creates a new maze layout and the player progresses to the next level, with each level becoming more challenging.

The maze is not pre-designed. JavaScript creates the layout by reading values from a maze array, meaning that walls, points, enemies and the player are all generated by the code. Each level therefore has a different layout, adding variety and increasing difficulty as the game continues.

The game includes key features such as a score counter, lives, level progression, a game-over screen, a restart option and a leaderboard stored using localStorage. Enemy characters move randomly and change direction when colliding with walls. When the player collides with an enemy, a life is lost. Once all lives are gone, the player can submit their name to be added to the leaderboard.

Accessibility was also considered. The game includes on-screen arrow controls for users who may struggle with keyboard movement, and a light mode option that changes the appearance while keeping gameplay fully functional.

Throughout development, I tested the game to ensure it behaved as expected. This involved playing the game to observe behaviour (black-box testing) and using the browser console to trigger functions such as level progression and game-over states. This allowed me to confirm that individual features worked correctly, both independently and together.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Build an interactive game using JavaScript  
- Create maze layouts and game elements using code  
- Implement both keyboard and on-screen controls  
- Detect collisions between players, enemies, walls and points  
- Manage score, lives, levels and game difficulty  
- Store and update leaderboard data using localStorage  
- Apply visual design and responsive layouts using CSS  
- Organise and structure JavaScript code clearly  

The project includes:

- **index.html** – game structure and menu  
- **script.js** – movement, maze creation, game logic and state handling  
- **style.css** – layout, colour themes and light/dark mode  
- **icon.png** – game icon  
- **AS2Report.docx** – written evaluation and testing report  

Snack Man is the most advanced JavaScript game I have created so far. It strengthened my problem-solving abilities, taught me how to manage game loops and improved my understanding of user interaction and interface design. It also demonstrates my ability to design, build and test a complete game from start to finish.
